			<div id="infoBox1">The Good Guys Limited was formed in 1988 by Managing Director Graham Dorward, with the aim of meeting the retail needs of our clients and their families. We take pride in our willingness to exceed expectations in terms of customer service and product. It is our goal to be identified and recognised over and above our competitors as "The Good Guys".

We understand the importance of building positive relationships with our customers and we demonstrate this belief through our actions and customer service. We focus on making interest free shopping easy and painless!

Provided that you meet our credit criteria, and agree to our terms and conditions, you can get your goods and pay them off as you wear them, and in most cases you can even have the goods before you make your first weekly or fortnightly payment!</div>
			<div id="infoBox2">All items purchased through The Good Guys Limited are available to you on our no cash needed, no fuss, revolving credit system, where you make your product selection from one of our mobile shops and while you are enjoying your purchase you make weekly or fortnightly payments to pay your purchase off, and just for your peace of mind we guarantee that there are no hidden costs to you and no surprise booking fees!

Here at The Good Guys each customer is given a credit rating and credit limit, this is determined by your weekly or fortnightly payment amount and your payment history - the more payments you make to The Good Guys Ltd the more credit you can potentially receive (terms and conditions apply).</div>
