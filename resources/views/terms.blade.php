The Customer must pay all outstanding monies (being those referred to in the Repayment Schedule, and the fees/expenses provided for in these terms and conditions together with any other monies owing to The Good Guys Ltd under any other purchase) on a date no later than agreed to with The Good Guys Ltd.
